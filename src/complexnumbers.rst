Complex numbers 
===============

Using SAGE for complex numbers
------------------------------

This chapter tells you how to use the free and Open-Source `SAGE mathematics software <http://www.sagemath.org/>`_
for studying complex numbers.

To use SAGE, you first need to start the SAGE program on your computer.
You should have already installed SAGE on your computer (if not, for instructions on how to
install SAGE, see `the SAGE Installation Guide <http://www.sagemath.org/doc/installation/>`_).

This booklet assumes that the reader has some basic knowledge of complex numbers,
and the principal focus of the booklet is not to explain complex numbers,
but rather how to study complex numbers using SAGE.

If you are new to complex numbers, and want to learn more about any of the concepts presented here, 
I would highly recommend the Open University book “Complex numbers” (product code MS221 chapter D1), available second-hand from from the 
`Open University Book Search <http://www.universitybooksearch.co.uk/>`_.

Adding, subtracting, multiplying and dividing complex numbers
-------------------------------------------------------------

Since Pythagoras, we know that :math:`a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

.. math::

   (a + b)^2 = a^2 + 2ab + b^2

   (a - b)^2 = a^2 - 2ab + b^2

In SAGE, we can use the symbol *i* in complex numbers, where:

.. math::

   i = sqrt(-1)

and a typical complex number *z* has the form:

.. math::

   z = a + bi

where *a* and *b* are real numbers.

Links and Further Reading
-------------------------

Some links are included here for further reading.

For background reading on complex numbers, 
I would recommend the Open University book “Complex numbers” (product code MS221 chapter D1), available second-hand from from the 
`Open University Book Search <http://www.universitybooksearch.co.uk/>`_.

For an in-depth introduction to SAGE, see the `SAGE documentation website <http://www.sagemath.org/help.html#SageStandardDoc>`_.
